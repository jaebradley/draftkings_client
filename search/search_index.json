It can be import ed directly from the draft_kings module. from draft_kings import Client Enums \u00b6 Various enum values are returned as part of the result set for API methods or as inputs for various API methods. They are import ed from the data path. Sport from draft_kings.data import Sport Note Represents the various sports that DraftKings has contests for, like the NFL, MLB, and NBA Output \u00b6 Data is returned as custom objects (and more specifically, instances of custom Class es that utilize the dataclasses module - which is why this project relies on Python 3.7+ ). The returned objects are (effectively) immutable via dataclasses 's frozen property . While immutability is just one reason behind using custom Class es, another benefit is making it easier to use this API with the type-hinting features introduced in Python 3 . Using Class es with defined types makes it (hopefully) much easier to discern what the (theoretically) expected type of any given field should be without having to print out some object. The output objects are located in the draft_kings.output.objects module. There are sub-modules that correspond to each DraftKings endpoint. Why is (pretty much) every field None -able / Optional ? \u00b6 This is a pretty explicit design decision I made when modeling the output data objects. Because I don't have any control of the shape of the data returned by the DraftKings endpoints, if DraftKings decides tomorrow to remove a field, I figured it would be better to return the field with a None value vs. raising some type of parsing / deserialization error. So most of the fields will have the potential of a None value - however, there are some fields that are guaranteed to always have a non- None value. Please check the appropriate Class es defined in the draft_kings.output.objects module if you would like to see the defined return types.
