# Home

This project is an _unofficial_ client for various "public" `HTTP` endpoints that are exposed by `draftkings.com`.

These endpoints are not documented anywhere (to the best of my knowledge), but do _not_ require any sort of 
authentication.

I am in no way affiliated with `draftkings.com`, and cannot make any guarantees about the underlying `HTTP` endpoints.

Additionally, I cannot make any guarantees about breaking changes associated with the **DraftKings** API / endpoints as
they are free to version and change their data as they see fit (again, to the best of my knowledge, there is no 
official API).

## Installation
